# Exercise 002

In this set of exercises we're going to explore the creation of your own objects.

You'll see a number of tests in [Exercise002Test.cs](../Exercises.Tests/Exercise002Tests.cs)

You'll be required to create C# objects (classes) to represent a "Person".

A Person has 4 properties/data associated with them:

* Their first name
* Their last name
* Their city
* Their age

You'll need to look at the methods and tests and update accordingly.
